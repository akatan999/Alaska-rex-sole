# Draft conclusions and recommendations

+ The  assessment of Alaska rex sole was conducted in March 2025 using the Stock Synthesis (SS) model (Methot & Wetzel 2013). This document is a comparison between the proposed "BaseCase" by the Assessment Team and alternative model configurations. A model that includes time varying selectivity and natural mortality might constitute a candidate alternative configuration to reduce misfit of length compositions and survey indices present in the current proposed baseline

+ 

+  

+   

# BaseCase Model Development

+ The assessment model is a two-area yearly model where the population is comprised of 20+ age-classes with two sexes (males and females are considered as separated). The model is a length-based model where the numbers at length in the fisheries and survey data are converted into ages using the von Bertalanffy growth function. The model started in 1982 and it includes 1 commercial fisheries and 2 surveys. 

+ This document presents a comparison between the model configurations tested by the assessment Team and additional configurations built to improve the fitting of the LFDs and survey indices.

+ SSB is above the target reference point and fishing pressure was estimated to be below the target reference point for all model configurations tested.


## Data revisions

## Work flow 

+ Run first the file Ensemble_grid.Rmd (as an R file, the Rmd is too large to compile), which creates input files for this files (Basecase model Alaska rex sole.Rmd). The Ensemble_grid.Rmd is used as guidance for selecting the BestCase using diagnostic as in Carvahlo et al., 2021 (BaseCase_TVsel_fleet_TVM in this case), and prepare objects for this file, where the BaseCase and the BestCase are compared.

## Model specifications

+ The reference model for Alaska rex sole is an annual, sex-structured length-age based Stock Synthesis model. The underlying age-structured dynamics is set up to comprise ages 0-20, where age 20 was treated as a plus group. The population was modeled as sex-structured with sex-specific parametrisation for somatic growth. Stock fecundity was assumed to be proportional to female spawning stock biomass. 

+ For the reference model, the sex specific growth is modeled for both sexes using Von Bertalanffy model. $L_at_Amin$ and $L_at_Amax$ were estimated. The CVs for $L_at_Amin$ and $L_at_Amax$ were estimated. 

```{r fig5, fig.height=5,fig.width=7, fig.cap = paste0("Growth functions for Female and Males.")}
sspar(mfrow=c(1,1),plot.cex = 0.7)
SSplotBiology(mod,subplots=1,main=F)

```

+ Female maturity was assumed to have the form of a logistic ogive with an age at 50\% maturity ($A_{m_{50}}$) being attained at 5.7 years and a slope of -1.11 1/cm (Figure 7). 

```{r fig6, fig.height=5,fig.width=7, fig.cap = paste0("Assumed Maturity ogive for females.")}
sspar(mfrow=c(1,1),plot.cex = 0.7)
SSplotBiology(mod,subplots=6,main=F)

```

+ Sex-specific natural mortality at age ($M_a$) were inputed as a single value (0.17)  

```{r fig7, fig.height=5,fig.width=7, fig.cap = paste0("Estimated variation in natural mortality vectors for females of area 1")}
knitr::include_graphics("basecase_TVsel_fleet_TVM/plots/bio24_time-varying_NatM_uniform_Fem_GP_1.png")
```


+ Nominal spawning and settling time were set to January 1st. The expected mean recruitment was assumed to follow a Beverton and Holt stock recruitment relationship. For the BaseCase a steepness of $h = 1.0$ was assumed. Recruitment deviations were estimated for 1982-2022 as main recruitment deviations and for the preceding years 1965-1982 as early recruitment deviations. Recruitment deviations were assumed to have a penalty of 0.6 on the standard deviation (sigmaR). 

+ All fleets assumed a double-normal (dome-shaped) selectivity (option 20). 

+ 

+ Fishing mortality was modeled using the hybrid F method (Option 3). In the original model, option three was selected for the fishing mortality (F) report basis. However, for this document Option five was selected for the fishing mortality (F) report basis only for representation and to allow the use of MVLN; this option corresponded to the simple unweighted average of the F of the age classes chosen to represent the Fbar (age 5â€“10).

## Model Diagnostics

Prepare outputs of retrospective runs (see Supplement for coding)

```{r}
retro.idx = r4ss::SSsummarize(retroModels,verbose = F)
retro.len = ss3diags::SSretroComps(retroModels)
```

### Survey indices

The BestCase model fitted all indices moderately well, with runs tests indicating mixed evidence for a systematic residual pattern.

```{r fig8, fig.height=8,fig.width=9, fig.cap = paste0("Fit, residual diagnostics and hindcast cross-validations for Survey Index")}
sspar(mfrow=c(3,2),plot.cex = 0.7)
for(i in 1:2){
SSplotIndices(ref,subplots = 2,fleets=i+1)
r=SSplotRunstest(ref,add=T,verbose = F,indexselect = i)
}

```

\pagebreak

+ Figure 8 check conflict between indices and mean length. As the value are under 30%, no major conflicts were found

```{r fig9, fig.height=8,fig.width=9, fig.cap = paste0("Joint residuals")}

SSplotJABBAres(ref,subplots="len",add=T,col=sscol(3)[c(1,3,2)])

```

### Size composition

+ The estimated selectivity curves for the BestCase are shown in Figure 9, with time-varying selectivity patterns for illustrated in Figure 10. 

+ The fits to the size composition (Figure 11) and conditional age-length-key data (data not shown) appeared overall adequate and only showed evidence for non-random residual patterns in few instances. Sex ratio at length by the current reference case is also satisfying (Figure 14).

```{r fig10, fig.height=6,fig.width=8, fig.cap = paste0("Estimated logistic selectivity curves by fleet")}

SSplotSexRatio(ref,kind="LEN")
```

\pagebreak

### Restropective Analysis 

+ The retrospective analysis showed a slightly retrospective pattern on $SSB$ from Mohn's Rho of 0.04, while the $F$ bias was -0.05. Forecast bias were similar to retrospective bias. All retrospective peels fell within the 95\% confidence intervals of the full model 

```{r fig16, fig.height=7,fig.width=9, fig.cap = paste0("Retrospective analysis and retrospective forecasts for the 2025 BestCase model")}
sspar(mfrow=c(2,2),plot.cex = 0.65)
r=SSplotRetro(retro.idx,add=T,legend=F,forecast=F,verbose = F)
r=SSplotRetro(retro.idx,add=T,forecastrho = T,legend=F,
            verbose = F,xlim=c(2005,2024))
r=SSplotRetro(retro.idx,subplots = "F",add=T,legend=F,forecast=F,
            verbose = F)
r=SSplotRetro(retro.idx,subplots = "F",add=T,forecastrho = T,legend=F,

mtext(c("Retro","Forecast"),3,outer=T,line=-0.5,at=c(0.3,0.8),cex=0.8)

```

### Hindcast Cross-Validations

Hindcast cross-validations indicated that the model has moderate prediction skill for the indices. By contrast, the model indicated good prediction skill for mean lengths and age (Figure 16).

```{r fig17, fig.height=8,fig.width=7, fig.cap = paste0("Fit and hindcast cross-validations for the Survey size compositions of the BestCase model")}
sspar(mfrow=c(2,3),plot.cex = 0.5)

```

```

SSplotHCxval(retroSummary,xmin=2006,add=T,legendcex = 0.6)

```


\pagebreak

### Profiling of steepness

The reference case  was further evaluated through profiling it over a range of steepness values $h = 0.45-0.95$.

Figure 22 shows that a higher range of $h = 0.90-0.95$ is supported by the total negative log-likelihood.

The stock estimates appear insensitive to alternative assumption about the steepness $h$ values tested (Figure 22)

```{r fig20, fig.height=8,fig.width=7, fig.cap = paste0("Negative log-likelihood profiles over a range of steepness values (h = 0.65-0.95)")}

# summarize output
profilesummary <- SSsummarize(profilemodels,verbose=F)
results <- SSplotProfile(profilesummary, add_cutoff = TRUE, verbose=F,
                         profile.string = "SR_BH_steep",
                         profile.label = "Stock-recruit steepness (h)")

```

    SSdeltaMVLN(x,add=T,run =paste0("h=",y),Fref = "Btgt",
                catch.type = "Exp",years=1982:2024,
                verbose = F,plot = F)},
           x=profilemodels,y=h)

sspar(mfrow=c(3,2),plot.cex = 0.7)

               legendloc = "topright",verbose = F)

```

+ Fishlife steepness value for the species is 0.72. The minimum likelihood is most likely an artifact of the historical trajectory of the stock, with little contrast in SSB due to the low fishing mortality. Due to asymmetric risk (Hordyk et al., 2019), it would be more appropriate to use a lower steepness value.

# Assessment outcome

## Reference Points

+ Reference points were estimated within the Stock Synthesis model, where the biomass reference points are considered as $SSB$ for females. For illustration only, target reference points of $B_{tgt} = SSB_{40}$ (biomass equal to 40 percent of unfished biomass $SBB_0$) and $F_{tgt}$ = $F_{SB40}$ (fishing mortality level at $SSB_{40}$) were proposed to serve a preliminary as proxies for $B_{MSY}$ and $F_{MSY}$. In the light of uncertainty about the underlying stock recruitment relationship, this choice of precautionary MSY proxies is likely to reduce the asymmetric risk of overfishing, while still attaining more than 95% of the theoretical MSY at FMSY and ensuring that about more 40\% more $SBB$ is left in the water to ensure both future recruitment and catch opportunities. 

+ When compared to the BaseCase, the BestCase improves the fit of the last year of the indices and the LFDs
